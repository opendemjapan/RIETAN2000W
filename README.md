# RIETAN-2000 Rev. 1.2 for Windows
Right-click the link to display a pop-up menu and choose "Save Link As...", "Save Target As...", or a corresponding item (depending on your browser). Drag and drop the downloaded file, rietan2000w.tbz, onto the icon of an archiver (refer to Archivers for Windows) to get a folder called 'RIETAN-2000 Folder'. For details in the uncompressing/extraction process, refer to instructions of the archiver carefully.
Read readme_win.txt in the 'RIETAN-2000 Folder' carefully to acquire further information. Note that gnuplot 3.7.1+1.2.0 is included in folder 'programs' to save time for its users.

# License agreement
I somewhat hesitate to make my dirty source code open. It is, however, indispensable for debugging the program, learning techniques of crystallographic computing, and implementing new features in RIETAN-2000. I have benefitted from a number of free software packages. I am, hence, willing to deliver RIETAN-2000 as open-source software licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL) plus additional conditions described in what follows.
Whenever original results acquired with RIETAN-2000 are published in journals, proceedings, facility reports, etc. or reported in scientific meetings with abstracts, the program name "RIETAN-2000" (or shortly "RIETAN") should explicitly be stated. Furthermore, cite the following paper:

F. Izumi and T. Ikeda, Mater. Sci. Forum, 321-324 (2000) 198-203.
Note that "321-324" is volume numbers while "198-203" is a range of pages. Only giving credit to RIETAN-2000 for Rietveld or Le Bail analysis is fine in the cases of abstracts, short reports, and so forth with limited spaces, e.g., as follows:
Structure parameters of CaTiO3 were refined by the Rietveld method from the X-ray diffraction data with RIETAN-2000.

So long as all the above conditions are satisfied, RIETAN-2000 is 'copylefted' with its source code freely available to everyone in the world. Anyone is free to copy, modify, redistribute, and sell it under the terms of the GPL. Providing pay services to users of RIETAN-2000 is welcome.

Although RIETAN-2000 has exhaustively been tested with intensity data of many compounds, it may still contain a fair number of bugs. RIETAN-2000 is distributed in the hope that it will be useful and reliable. It is, however, provided "as is'' without any warranty since I have a number of commitments on my time. There is no charge for the program, per se, whereas technical service concerning it is not free.
